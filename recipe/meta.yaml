  # For some reason, 0.17.0 dropped the `.0` patch component from its GitHub
  # archive names, so we need to munge the version string to avoid getting a
  # 404 when downloading the sources.  Note that conda-forge set its conda
  # package version to "0.17", but we are not doing that for defaults because
  # we want our conda package's version string to match the version string the
  # upstream authors published to PyPI.

build:
  # Upstream has seemingly not put any effort into fixing the broken C
  # components in `skrf.src`, so we may as well turn treat this as a pure
  # Python package like conda-forge has done since v0.14.9.
